Please download this repository and then unzip the folder in your preferred location. Then open the anaconda powershell prompt (windows) or the terminal/shell (mac / linux) and cd to the repository location. (e.g. by typing cd C:\Documents\SysNeuro)

In the folder should be located a file named environments.yml -- make sure you are in the folder in the powershell/terminal/shell prompt, then create a new conda environment by typing conda env create -f environment.yml . This will install all the necessary packages to run the homework. 

Activate the environment by typing conda activate gstools (or whatever you named the environment, if you changed it's name).

Launch the jupyter notebook by typing jupyter notebook. 

from the website that pops up, select the Homework 1.ipynb file, and open it to view the first homework. You can modify this file in place on your computer, then upload just the .ipynb file to canvas to submit your homework.
